üîç Troubleshooting:
[2025-05-03T21:53:43.242Z] 1. Make sure your forked mainnet is running (npm run fork)
[2025-05-03T21:53:43.244Z] 2. Make sure you've deployed both contracts (npm run deploy:fork and npm run deploy:enhanced)
[2025-05-03T21:53:43.246Z] 3. Check fork-config.json for correct contract addresses
[2025-05-03T21:53:43.248Z] 4. Try restarting your fork and redeploying the contracts
